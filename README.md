# Assignment Theory
## Question 1:
I’ve created a milestone with name ‘Launch of Eco friendly Clothing Website’

- The Launch is a critical point for the Eco-Friendly clothing Website as it moves from the development phase to the market.

- It represents the hard work of the developers in Planning, Designing, Manufacturing and Delivering the final product.

- If this milestone is a success then it will directly affect the brand’s sales, growth and revenue generation.

## Question 2:
There are 5 issue in my project that I’ve to tackle they are as the following:
- One bug report
- One feature request
- Incomplete Task
- Outdated Product information
- Incorrect font size all over the website.


## Question 3 & 4:
In the Project board I’ve created 3 tabs named To-Do, In Progress and Done.
In my project to launch the website on 30th October 2024, My main focus is to resolve the main 2 issues in the website i.e., One bug report and Incorrect font size all over the website.
As these issues are the one which the customer will see in the first place that’s why I am focusing on resolving these issues on a priority basis.

All of the other issues are the one which can also be completed after the website is launched. 

## Question 5:
Using Github’s project management feature, such as milestones, issues, project boards
significantly enhances team collaboration and project organization. By creating clear milestones, the team can clearly state the specific goal and deadline making it easier to track the progress. 
Issues option focuses mainly to document and manage tasks, bugs, and adding a new feature, allowing team members to communicate effectively. 
And lastly, project boards serve as visual tools that can help the team see the status of various tasks at a glance, streamlining workflow and enabling better time management.
